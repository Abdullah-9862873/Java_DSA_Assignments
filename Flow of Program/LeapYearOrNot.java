/*
Pseudo Code
----> If the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year except for the century years... For example 2100 is not a leap year but it is divisible by 4

----> So we have to check if the year is a centry year or not... If it is then it must be divisible by 400 otherwise its not a leap year...
